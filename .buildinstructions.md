## Models:
- These are the representations of your database tables. In this case, you'll have two models: User and Coin.
- Your Sequelize models will be used to interact with your database. In your user.js, you'll define the User model with fields like username, password, etc. In your coin.js, you'll define the Coin model with fields like name, year, denomination, and mintmark.

## User:
- This should include fields for username, password, and possibly email if you plan on including password recovery. You'll use Passport.js for authentication related to this model.

## Coin:
- This should include fields for name, year, denomination, and mintmark.

## Views:
- Handlebars will be used to create the views. You'll need several views for your application.
- Handlebars is a templating engine that allows you to create reusable HTML templates, so you'll have different Handlebars templates for different parts of your application.

1. The main.handlebars file will be your main layout. It will include things like your website's header and footer, and any CSS or JavaScript files you want to include. You'll also include a placeholder ({{{body}}}) where all your other templates will be inserted.
2. In index.handlebars, you might display a list of all coins, for example, or a welcome message and login/signup buttons for users who aren't logged in.
You could have partials like coin.handlebars and user.handlebars that define how to display a single coin or user.

## Login/Signup:
- This view will allow users to either login or signup to use the app.

## Home:
- This view will display the user's coin collection, perhaps as a table or list.

## Add/Edit coin: 
- his view will allow users to add a new coin to their collection or edit an existing one.

## Controllers:
- These handle the business logic of your application. You'll have a few controllers for handling the various interactions between your models and views.
- Controllers act as an interface between your models and views. When a user makes a request (like asking to see their profile page), the appropriate controller will use the models to fetch the relevant data, insert that data into the appropriate view, and then send the filled-out view to the user's browser.

1. In this case, you might have routes in userController.js like /login, /signup, and /profile, and routes in coinController.js like /coins, /coins/:id, and /user/:id/coins.

## Authentication Controller:
- This will handle user signup and login.

## Coin Controller:
- This will handle adding, editing, and deleting coins from a user's collection.

### Here is a general flow of how the models, views, and controllers interact:

- User navigates to your website and sees the Login/Signup view. The user can create a new account or login to an existing one. This interaction is handled by the Authentication Controller.

- After logging in, the user is directed to the Home view. The Home view fetches the user's coin collection from the database via the Coin Controller and displays them.

- From the Home view, the user can navigate to the Add/Edit coin view to add a new coin or edit an existing one. The Add/Edit coin view uses the Coin Controller to add or update coins in the database.

### Passprt Integration
1. User Registration: When a user registers, you would typically hash the password and store the hashed version in your database. This ensures that even if your database is compromised, the actual passwords of your users are not immediately exposed.
2. User Login: When a user logs in, you take the provided username and password, hash the password in the same way as you did during registration, and compare it to the hashed password you have stored in your database. If they match, the user provided the correct password.
3. Session Management: Upon successful login, Passport will establish a persistent login session. This is done by serializing the user, which often involves just storing the user's ID in the session cookie. The session cookie is then sent to the client and included with subsequent requests to the server.
4. Deserialization: On each request, Passport will deserialize the user from the session. This typically involves looking up the user by ID in your database and storing the result in req.user for use in your route handlers.
5. Access Control: You can check if req.user is defined in your route handlers to determine if the user is logged in. You can then allow or deny the request based on this and potentially other factors, such as user roles or permissions.

## User Routes (UserController.js)

- GET `/` - The homepage, possibly showing a login form or the user's dashboard if they're already logged in
- GET `/register` - The registration form
- POST `/register` - Endpoint to create a new user
- GET `/login` - The login form
- POST `/login` - Endpoint to authenticate a user
- GET `/logout` - Endpoint to log a user out
- GET `/dashboard` - The user dashboard, showing their coin collection

## Coin Routes (CoinController.js)

- GET `/coins` - Shows all coins
- POST `/coins` - Endpoint to add a new coin to the logged-in user's collection
- GET `/coins/:id` - Shows the details of a specific coin

### User Model
```javascript
const { Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = require('../config/connection');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

class User extends Model {
    checkPassword(loginPw) {
        return bcrypt.compareSync(loginPw, this.password);
    }
}

User.init(
    {
        username: {
            type: DataTypes.STRING,
            allowNull: false,
            unique: true,
        },
